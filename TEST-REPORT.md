## Remaining Demo-Only Functionality

These features work in **demo mode only** (when running in browser without Electron):

| Feature | Browser Behavior | Electron Behavior |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Deploy | Fake URLs | Real Vercel/Railway (if CLI installed) |
| Tests | Demo test results | Real `npm test` execution |
| Dev Server | Not available | Real `npm run dev` execution |

This is **by design** - browser mode is for demos/previews.
